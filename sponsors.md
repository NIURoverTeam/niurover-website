title: Sponsors
calltoaction: NIU Mars rover is a student run organization, and our funding comes from both the college and outside sponsors. The club's purpose is to educate and prepare students for life after graduation &mdash; applying the skills they learn in the classroom on real world design challenges.  We don't have everything we need to accomplish this goal on our own.  If you are interested in sponsoring us, or would like to get in contact, email us at [niurover@gmail.com](mail:niurover@gmail.com).
