calltoaction: NIU Mars rover is a student run organization, and our funding comes from both the college and outside sponsors. The club's purpose is to educate and prepare students for life after graduation &mdash; applying the skills they learn in the classroom on real world design challenges.  We rely on generous sponsorship to help us accomplish that goal. If you are interested in sponsoring us, or would like to get in contact, please email us at <a href="mailto:niurover@gmail.com">niurover@gmail.com</a>.
