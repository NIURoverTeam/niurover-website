# Picus Martius

<!-- Picture of Picus here -->

The NIU Mars Rover team officially started in July 2017, but its origins date to the year before in August of 2016. Five engineering seniors from Northern Illinois University - Matthew Woodall, Tim Olson, Gunnar Beachler, Dan Petschow, and Tom Jareczek -  designed, machined, programmed, and worked together to create a rover for their senior design. They received first place for their efforts at the NIU Spring 2017 Mechanical Engineering Senior Design showcase. The club that would follow it was built off their efforts with the purpose of educating and challenging students, and inherited the rover they had built. 

That rover was named Picus Martius. If you're curious about the etymology of the name, it comes from the taxonomy of the Great Black Woodpecker, which the Romans believed to be a [Sacred Animal of Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_(mythology)#Sacred_animals). After 2 years of valiant service, Picus Martius was officially retired in the Fall of 2018. 

# Ad Astra

After Picus Martius was retired, the team got to designing and building our new rover, Ad Astra. The name comes from Latin, meaning “to the stars”. Using lessons learned from the design, manufacture, and operation of Picus, this new rover featured many improvements over its predecessor. It also drew direct inspiration from Picus, and inherited some key design elements and even whole parts and systems.

While still in operation, Ad Astra will soon be seeing a rather extensive overhaul/retrofit, including an all new chassis design and electrical system.
