The University Rover Challenge (URC) is a yearly competition that features a wide variety of challenges for the rovers that compete. The URC challenges us to design and build the next generation of Mars rovers, with competition tasks ranging from navigating in long distance, collecting samples, and testing the samples. In addition to being able to carry out these tasks, our rover must also fit within certain cost, size, and weight constraints provided by the competition rules. There are four major tasks to the URC: Extreme Retrieval and Delivery Task, Equipment Servicing Task, Science Task, and the Autonomous Traversal Task.
