  <h1>Welcome to NIU Mars Rover!</h1>
  <p>Open to all majors, the Northern Illinois University Mars Rover Team is a student organization in NIU's College of Engineering and Engineering Technology. The team offers students the opportunity to learn about the design, fabrication, and integration of mechanical, electrical, and computer systems - key aspects of the rover's operation. All of these components come together to perform scientific tasks such as analyzing soil samples for life.  The team competes in the <a href="http://urc.marssociety.org/">University Rover Challenge</a>, held each year in May.</p>
