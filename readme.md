## Tips and Tricks
Sponsors can be edited under `_includes/footer.html`.

Sponsor logos can be managed under `assets/logos/`.

Profile pictures, blog photos, and general photos are under `assets/photos/`.

"Blog Posts" can be edited under `_posts/`.

"Pages" can be managed in the root.  Simply add a `<name>.md` file.  Files in the root should use the following header block:
```markdown
---
layout: page
title: Capitalized Title
calltoaction: (This is optional, but is the smaller text in the same block as the title text.)
permalink: /title-but-web-friendly/
---
```
