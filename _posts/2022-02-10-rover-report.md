### Rover Updates
This week the Electrical Sub-team tested and connected the kill switch, redrew the electrical diagrams, tested the water pump for the science task, and began writing pseudo-code for the arm. The Mechanical Sub-team introduced new members to the rover and parts currently designed and, began manufacturing of the forearm. The Programming Sub-team has been working through the tutorials for robot sim with webots, the GUI group took notes on what all should be part of the interface, and some work was done on getting the jetson nano connected to shatterdome over radio comms. The Science Task Sub-team has been working on connecting a pump system to the testing bed.

## And as always, thank you to our sponsors!
