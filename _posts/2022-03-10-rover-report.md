### Rover Updates
This week the Electrical Sub-team began integrating the new motors and selecting a controller. The Mechanical Sub-team Finished up old designs and began to move onto new ones. The Programming Sub-team got a model of Ad Boxtra showing in Webot, though not in its finished form, they also began working on the control schemes for the arm. The Science Task Sub-team has been working on webcam/sensor functionality and doing further research on our chemical tests.

## And as always, thank you to our sponsors!
