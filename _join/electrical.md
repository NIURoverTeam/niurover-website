What the Mars Rover Electrical Team does is find solutions for making the Rover function. We design the electrical system of the Mars Rover, which makes the rover function (move, arm operate, and so on.) We are the heart of the rover, we bring the Rover to life. We are looking for people who have experience in building robotics, Physics Majors, Computer Science Majors, Electrical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering Tech Majors.
