![Computer Science students working on autonomous navigation software](/assets/images/2019_sar_cs.png)

The Computer Science subteam is tasked with the design, development, implementation, and testing of any and all software needed for the Rover's operation. This includes Teleoperation, Autonomous Navigation, Computer Vision, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), User Interface Design, Sensor Integration, Pose Estimation, and more. In order to accomplish this, we use the [Robotic Operating System](https://www.ros.org/), writing code primarily in Python and C++.

If you're an NIU student and any of that sounds interesting to you, reach out! We welcome members of any major or level of experience, and we do a Crash Course in ROS development every fall that covers all the basics.

Students interested in joining can fill out the [our Interest Form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=kDOH6hyMMUKnmWtaAjWy5p6spiA05yZBk7bWP9yzOp9UN0ZYTUhCOU02VlFQMVRPUEc2Mk1aQjlTRS4u). From this, your student email will be added to our mailing list.
