The Outreach subteam handles designing the website, banner, and fundraising items such as t-shirts and water bottles.  Members present the club to sponsors and prospective new members, keeping tabs on the progress of the other subteams.

Our subteam is a great fit for folks of all majors.  We strive to keep the community engaged, showcase the successes of the club, and help the club get the resources they need.

Students interested in joining can fill out the [CEET Student Interest Form](https://fs19.formsite.com/niuform/hnsslqzhsh/index.html). Choose the "Mars Rover Team" and make sure you include in the comment what subteams you're interested in participating in.
