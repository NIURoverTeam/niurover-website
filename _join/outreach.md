The Outreach subteam handles designing the website, banner, and fundraising items such as t-shirts and water bottles.  Members present the club to sponsors and prospective new members, keeping tabs on the progress of the other subteams.

Our subteam is a great fit for folks of all majors.  We strive to keep the community engaged, showcase the successes of the club, and help the club get the resources they need.
