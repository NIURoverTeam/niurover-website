Our goal is to design and build a fully functional robotic arm in order to complete various tasks in the URC Rover Competition. We spend a lot of our time designing new systems for the arm and gripper, and putting those ideas into practice.Our team is newcomer friendly, and we're always looking for more help! Whether you're a first semester freshman with no experience or a second year graduate student, you're more than welcome to throw your ideas into the hat!

We spend the majority of the Fall semester designing and refining ideas, and start our manufacturing near the end of the semester. All of our manufacturing is hands on, so all team members will be able to help after getting trained in the machine shop.
