The science team is a combination of all majors. Mechanical designs the soil collection mechanisms and laboratory components. Electrical wires the various sensors, motors, actuators, and any other part that needs power while Computer Science programs them. The physics and chemists of the team compile research and experiment with different procedures for finding signs of life.

The mission of the science task is to evaluate a given environment for the existence of life. We relate research from inhabitable conditions on earth to the conditions that would occur on Mars. Tactics and analysis that NASA has successfully employed are implemented onto our Rover.
