The Science Task subteam is a collaborative effort between the Rover team's different disciplines.

Physicists, Chemists, and other domain scientists of the team compile research and experiment with different procedures for finding signs of life in a pseudo-Martian environment.

Mechanical engineers design the soil collection mechanisms and laboratory components.

Electrical Engineers manage the sensors, motors, and actuators.

Computer Scientists program the components.

Our mission is to evaluate a given environment for the existence of life. We relate research from inhabitable conditions on earth to the conditions that would occur on Mars. We employ the same tactics in our rover that NASA has studied and implemented.
