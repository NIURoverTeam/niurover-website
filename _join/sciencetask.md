The Science Task subteam is a collaborative effort between the Rover team's different disciplines.
Mechanical Engineers design the soil collection mechanisms and laboratory components neccessary for the competition. 
Electrical Engineers manage the various sensors, motors, actuators, and other electrical components, while our Computer Scientists program them. 
The physicists, chemists, and other domain scientists of the team compile research and experiment with different procedures for finding signs of life in a pseudo-Martian environment.

The mission of the science task is to evaluate a given environment for the existence of life. We relate research from inhabitable conditions on earth to the conditions that would occur on Mars. Tactics and analysis that NASA has successfully employed are implemented in our Rover for competition.
